# Limitations
1. This is my hobby project, so this is not of production quality. I made this for personal use so I am not planning to enhance this unless there is significant number of users. But feel free to contribute
2. This is a very minimal, functional, chrome extension. No options, no settings.
3. Less Code Quality - Though I have tried to follow some quality, still there is much room for improvements such as exception handling
